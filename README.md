# LeetCode Submissions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems.

The goal of this repo is **practice and progress tracking**, not clean abstractions or production-quality code.  
Some solutions may be suboptimal, repetitive, or rewritten multiple times as my understanding improves.

If you're looking for elegant, heavily-documented solutions — this is probably not the right place.

## Notes

- Not all solutions are optimal.
- Some files may be missing explanations or comments.
- Older solutions may be worse than newer ones — that’s expected.

This repo exists to document **learning**, not perfection.

## Disclaimer

Do **not** blindly copy these solutions for interviews or assignments.  
Understand the approach, trade-offs, and edge cases before using anything here.
